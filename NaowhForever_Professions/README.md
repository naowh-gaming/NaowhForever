# Professions

Naowh's profession window in place of the game's: your recipes by category with the ones you
have not learned below them, the chosen recipe in the middle (reagents, profit, craft buttons, or
where to learn it), Blizzard's own profession tabs on its edge, and an overview card for each
profession. Around it: craft orders from another player's link, buying reagents on the auction
house or at a merchant, a shopping list, your favourite recipes at the trainer and the auction
house, a next-rank alert, a batch craft timer and a tracking reminder. Laid out like the
[Dungeon Journal](../NaowhForever_DungeonJournal/README.md), on [`Shared/`](../Shared/README.md).

Each layer uses only the ones above it, or reads a later one's table at call time.

## Why

- The on/off switches' defaults (`enabled` and each feature's switch) are read from
  `ns.FEATURES.professions`; their options keep their own defaults in `Professions.lua`.
- Blizzard's window stays open under ours at zero alpha: hiding it would close the trade skill (its
  OnHide calls CloseTradeSkill) and take the recipe data with it. Ours sits one strata higher, so
  nothing of Blizzard's can be clicked, and is never narrower or shorter than it.
- Blizzard's profession tabs switch profession by casting its spell, which only Blizzard's code may
  do, so the real tabs move onto our window's edge and ignore their invisible parent's alpha.
- The overview's spell buttons (Smelting, Find Minerals) cast and the red cross unlearns, so they stay
  Blizzard's. A card draws its buttons as part of itself, so Blizzard's whole card moves into ours with
  its art at zero alpha; the buttons stay children of that card, where their click reads the
  spellbook offset. They are secure: docked out of combat only, and undocked whenever the overview
  is not showing.
- With the overview docked our window holds secure buttons and is protected, so closing it in combat
  makes it transparent instead of hiding it. Resizing waits for combat to end for the same reason.
- Once dragged, Blizzard's window is moved to where ours was put, out of combat only (it holds secure
  buttons); anchoring it to ours instead would make ours protected. The panel manager places it
  again whenever any panel opens or closes, so its SetPoint is hooked.
- A trade link reads `trade:<crafter GUID>:<spell>:<skill line>`; only a plain click opens it. Opened
  from a closed window, a link does not always read as linked yet, so the click is remembered. A
  link clicked while Blizzard's window is loaded but closed makes Forever cast every one of your
  professions and land on the last, so it is clicked once more after `RETRY_AFTER` (0.5s). The view
  ends when the window closes, but not on the close the click itself causes (`SETTLE`, 1s), or when
  you cast one of your own professions. Mining's window opens with Smelting (2656), not a spell
  named after the profession.
- Forever answers `numAvailable` with 0, so how many you can make is worked out from the reagents.
- The recipe schematic is the current API; the reagent-info calls are kept as a fallback. A recipe's
  reagents and output never change, so each is read once and shared read-only; only a schematic that
  loaded and makes nothing is final.
- An item whose name is not loaded is asked for, and ITEM_DATA_LOAD_RESULT for one asked for redraws
  the window once. Other item loads (the auction house loads hundreds) redraw nothing.
- Shift-click links through ChatFrameUtil: the ChatEdit_ names are deprecated shims Forever does not
  load. The active chat window alone does not say you are typing: with some chat settings there
  always is one, so its focus is checked.
- Difficulty colours are Enum.TradeskillRelativeDifficulty: 0 Optimal, 1 Medium, 2 Easy, 3 Trivial
  (no more skill).
- The skill bar's dark end is 55% of a changed accent; the shipped blue (#004f85) stays otherwise.
- The list is wide enough for a recipe name, its count and a full profit ("-12g 07s 09c"). Counts sit
  in a right-aligned column as wide as the widest on screen, so every icon and name starts in line,
  never left of `ICON_X` (24), which keeps recipes indented under their headers.
- The rank banner pushes both columns down 46 while it shows. Filter is 76 wide for "Filter (3)".
  The Buy, Add to List and Create rows share one width, so they line up; the reagent rows end 4
  short of Create, hence the Buy row's 4 overhang.
- Bind on Equip also counts items that never bind (bindType 0): on the beta much crafted gear does not
  bind and still sells on the auction house.
- Favourites are kept by spell ID, which is also a known recipe's recipeID. A known one is told to
  the game too, so Blizzard's own favourites count; an unlearned one lives only in the profile.
- Prices: a reagent costs its vendor price once a merchant was seen selling it, else the lowest buyout
  at the last scan; the auction house keeps 5% of a sale. Profit is cached per recipe until the next
  full draw, so scrolling and the filter do not price every recipe again. Reagents unchecked in the
  pane are ones you have, left out of every recipe's cost.
- Merchants teach the vendor reagents: trade goods sold for gold without a stock limit are kept
  account-wide, with their price when Crafting Profit is on. That listener runs whatever the switch.
- Buying only runs from a click: each auction house step is a button, and Confirm is the only one
  that spends gold. A search waits 5s for an answer, a purchase 15s (it settles slower); a purchase
  answering after its timeout still went through. A live price 25% over the last scan is warned
  about. Skip and Cancel are off while a purchase pays, or it would be spent but not counted.
- At a merchant only plain gold purchases are bought, never extended costs; items sold several to a
  purchase round up to whole purchases, and limited stock caps the amount.
- Walking up to an anvil changes whether a recipe's requirements are met: SPELL_UPDATE_USABLE is
  listened to only while the window shows, and redraws the pane at most twice a second.
- Craft orders are kept per crafter until sent or a reload, up to 9 crafts. Messages go 0.4s apart so
  chat does not throttle them, split at 255 characters with item links counted in full. The tip is
  at least 1s, rounded to the silver under 1g, to 10s under 10g, else to the gold. The crafter is
  matched in your group by the link's GUID, else by name without your realm; the order goes to party
  (or instance) chat when they are in your party, else by whisper, also in a raid.
- Forever's GetProfessions answers prof1, prof2, First Aid, Fishing, Cooking; the overview runs
  Cooking, Fishing, First Aid, as Blizzard's book does.
- Profession trainers on Forever ask less than Wowhead lists, so what a trainer window asks is kept
  account-wide, matched by name within its profession (the service list has no spell IDs).
- Forever's GetTrainerServiceInfo returns its values in another order than documented (the third is
  the icon's file ID, seen 2026-09-30), so the kind is whichever value is one of its words and the
  icon the first number over 1000. A trainer's services can arrive a moment after it opens with no
  event, so Train Favorites looks again at 0.2, 0.6 and 1.5s. Learning goes from the last index first:
  buying a service can renumber the ones after it.
- A pattern bought waits in the mailbox, where the game cannot be asked, so it stays off the list for
  30 days (how long auction mail keeps) unless it turns up in your bags or bank first. Patterns are
  single listings; their live prices are looked up one at a time, 0.3s apart, so the auction house's
  limit on searches is never hit.
- Starting a commodity purchase is protected (ADDON_ACTION_BLOCKED when tried on its own, seen
  2026-09-30), so the shopping list buys each material after the first on a click of Buy Next. A
  final price 10% over the check is warned about. A search sent while the auction house is busy is
  dropped, so the check waits for it to be ready.
- The shopping list makes a material from its parts, up to 4 levels down, only when whole crafts cost
  less than buying what is needed, and never from a recipe with a cooldown (it makes a few a day; a
  shared cooldown can read 0 on the spell). What was bought counts at every level, and a craft taken
  off takes its purchases along. Every craft fires TRADE_SKILL_LIST_UPDATE, so the recipes known are
  recorded again only when they changed, 0.5s after the list settles.
- Herbalism and Skinning have no recipes: their ranks are Mining's (same skill and cost) and their
  trainers come from the town map data. A rank needs level 10, 20 and 35 for caps 150, 225 and 300
  unless its data says otherwise.
- The Tracking Reminder is a secure spell button, since casting is Blizzard-only. It cannot show, hide
  or change spell in combat: it hides on PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED, the last moment InCombatLockdown is
  still false, and catches up when combat ends. The minimap's tracking info is read as a table or as
  values, since which one Forever returns was not pinned down.
- The Total Craft Timer takes the Flight Timer's measures and spot, as nobody crafts in flight. The
  player cast bars (EllesmereUI's and Blizzard's) stay at zero alpha for the batch, since their own
  code shows them on every cast. Forever may report a cast time of 0 until it is cast, so 3s stands
  in. Pressing Create mid-craft fails that press while the batch casts on, so that failure is
  ignored. A batch with no craft event 5s past its expected end has stopped. Its hooks are installed
  the first time it is switched on and stay, idle while it is off.
- Bag room is played out craft by craft on what the bags hold: the item onto a stack with room, else
  a free slot that can take it; the reagents out, smallest stack first (seen in game 2026-09-30), each
  emptied stack freeing its slot. A profession bag takes only its kind, the reagent bag only reagents.
- RecipeData's NPC rows are `{ npcID, name, faction ("A", "H", "AH" or "-"), uiMapID, x, y [, cost] }`
  (`P.C.NPC_*`); `t` lists are indices into the profession's trainers. Drops are `{ mob, areaID,
  minLevel, maxLevel, chance }`. Costs are copper. Stormwind and Eastern Plaguelands rows were moved
  to Forever's redrawn maps.
- VendorReagents are flux, thread, vials, salt and spices, water and milk, rods, coal, wood, stocks,
  bleach and dyes. CooldownRecipes are Transmute: Arcanite (2 days), the other transmutes but Elemental
  Fire (1 day, shared) and Mooncloth (4 days).

## Checking

- `luacheck NaowhForever_Professions` from the repo root.
- `lua Tools/regression/test-professions-memory.lua` loads every file Professions.xml lists against
  stubs and times and weighs what runs while the window is open.
- The window's slices: `test-profession-combat-close.lua`, `test-profession-window-drag.lua`
  (Takeover.lua), `test-profession-link-view.lua` (LinkView.lua), `test-profession-shift-click.lua`
  (AuctionHouse.lua), `test-shopping-list-plan.lua` (ShoppingPlan.lua), and the looks in
