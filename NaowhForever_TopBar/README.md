# Top Bar

`[buttons] [clock] [buttons]` across the top of the screen, with the FPS / MS readout under it.
One saved layout orders the buttons on each side: Friends, Guild and Hearthstone (secure
buttons) and any addon's LibDataBroker launcher. Its card on the QoL Interface page has a live
preview that edits the layout: drag a button to move it, its x removes it, a side's + adds one.
The bar moves in the HUD Editor. `/nf lockouts` prints your saved instances. Its TOC depends on
NaowhForever_QoL, where its card is: switching QoL off takes the Top Bar with it.

Each layer uses only the ones above it. The bar hands its buttons the function that fades it
(`UpdateHover`) when it makes them.

## Why

- The clock's font is EllesmereUI's ("Gotham Narrow Ultra"), found through SharedMedia; without
  it the clock falls back to the Addon Font.
- Our own launchers have glyphs of their own (`GLYPH`); any other launcher's icon is desaturated
  and tinted to match.
- Friends and Guild are secure buttons that click Blizzard's own button, the first of
  `CLICK_THROUGH` that exists, so the click opens its panel even in combat. They are made out of
  combat only.
- The pills take the player's Background color through `ns.ThemeTint`; the clock's and the
  tooltips' whites and greys (`WHITE`, `LABEL_GREY`, `EMPTY_GREY`, `MORE_GREY`) stay the shade they
  always were unless the theme changed Text or Secondary Text. The AFK and DND tags keep their grey
  (`AWAY_GREY`) unless the theme changed Secondary Text.
- Show On Mouseover fades the bar instead of hiding it, as it holds secure buttons. Every enter
  and leave on the bar or its buttons fades it again, since a leave into a gap fires nothing else.
- The bar takes mouse motion only, so the gaps between its buttons still click through.
- The clock opens the calendar with `ShowUIPanel` from our click, which is forbidden while
  `ns.GamepadOwnsPanels()`, so then it only says so.
- `SYS_DROP` (2) is how far the FPS / MS readout sits under the bar, on screen and in the preview
  alike, so it lives in `Constants.lua` with `ROUND` (0.5, added before `math.floor`).
- Each slider range on the card is a named table at the top of `UI/SettingsPage.lua`; Bar Opacity
  and Faded Opacity share `ALPHA_RANGE`, the house 0 to 100 opacity range from `Shared/Style.lua`.
- The FPS / MS readout is a sibling on `UIParent`, not a child of the bar, so Hide In Combat leaves
  it up: it sits under the bar while the bar shows, and where the bar was once it is hidden.
- Hide In Combat uses a state driver: hiding a frame that holds secure buttons is protected in
  combat. Everything `Apply` does moves or shows secure buttons, so in combat it waits for
  `PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED`, and so does fitting the bar's width.
- `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD` comes after every addon's login, so late launchers exist by then: the
  bar is applied again there.
- `GetSavedInstanceInfo`'s reset counts down from the last `UPDATE_INSTANCE_INFO`, not from now.
- `ROSTER_CAP` (40) keeps a big guild's tooltip on the screen.
- Roster names and zones can come back secret in combat, so the friends and guild lists wait for
  combat to end.
- `GuildRoster()` answers later and is rate limited, so the guild list may be a request behind: the
  tooltip asks at most every 10 seconds, the badges every 15.
- The tooltips are shown at Tooltip Size; `GameTooltip`'s own scale comes back when it hides. That
  hook is made with the bar's first tooltip, not at load.
- The addon memory scan is a frame spike, so it runs at most every 30 seconds; a click on the
  readout runs it again.
- The resting "zzz" is an 8-frame flipbook, 16 columns across the top half of its texture.
- The game's top-centre display (battleground scores, capture bars) hangs from the top of the
  screen (`WIDGETS_Y`, -15), under a Top Bar left there. It goes below the bar and its FPS / MS,
  `WIDGETS_GAP` (4) under, and back once the bar is off or moved away; `WIDGETS_ROOM` (60) is how
  far down the bar may reach and still be in its way. One another addon has placed is left where
  it is.
- The preview's edit layer sets an `OnKeyDown` script, which turns keyboard input on; it is turned
  off again until a drag starts. With no drag, Escape still reaches the options window. A drag
  that ends in combat cannot turn the keyboard off.
- The old button keys (`showFriends`, `showGuild`, `showHearth`, `brokers`, `brokerSide`) become
  the saved layout once, and Dungeon Quests (`NaowhForeverDQ`) became the Dungeon Journal.

## Checking

- `luacheck TopBar` from the repo root.
- `lua Tools/regression/test-topbar-layout.lua`: the layout, its migration, the drawing order and
  the preview's remove, move and add.
- `lua Tools/regression/test-topbar-look.lua`, `test-topbar-readout.lua`,
  `test-topbar-mouseover.lua`, `test-topbar-widgets.lua` and `test-lockouts.lua`: the look, the
  readout, the fade, the top-centre display and the saved instances, on stubs.
