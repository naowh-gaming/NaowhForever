"""Read WoW Forever's dungeon loot from wowsrc.com, an independent, non-commercial WoW Forever
fan site (its robots.txt: "Crawl it freely"). Each of its loot pages lists a dungeon's bosses,
and under each the items it drops, Forever's new ones marked, with the drop chance the game
reports; it says its item data is the game's own. That places what Wowhead has not tied to a
boss yet (Worgenbane Talisman under Commander Springvale).

The pages are fetched politely (one every couple of seconds, saying who we are) and kept in
Tools/wowsrc_pages/ (not committed: delete a file to fetch it again, or pass --fresh); what
they say is written to Tools/wowsrc_loot.json:
  { dungeon slug: { "name", "updated", "bosses": [ { "name", "items": [ { "name", "quality",
    "level", "slot", "type", "chance" (percent or null), "new" } ] } ] } }
The pages give no item IDs, so items are matched by name: Tools/item_names.json maps each name
to its ID, filled from what we already have (the dungeon loot list, the game's item tables)
and, for the rest, by --resolve, which asks Wowhead's Classic search (names and IDs are the
same in Forever for Classic items, whose names the game's exported tables leave out) and
keeps only an ID that is in Forever's own item table. The build reads only the map, never a
search: a name not in it is reported, never guessed.

--check is the daily check (.github/workflows/daily-watch.yml): it reads the pages fresh and
says what changed on them since wowsrc_loot.json, which the Journal was last built from:
items a boss gained or lost, bosses and dungeon pages added or gone. Drop chances are left
out (they move with every kill counted). Each item gained says its ID where we know it:
from item_names.json, else the game's own item table (wago.tools; Forever's new items are
all there by name), so only an old classic item waits for --resolve. It only reads wowsrc
and the game's tables; bringing a change in needs Wowhead (an item's details), so that stays
a run on our machines.

Usage: python Tools/wowsrc.py [--fresh]     fetch and read the loot pages
       python Tools/wowsrc.py --resolve     add the names not mapped yet to item_names.json
                                            (--offline: from our data and the game's tables only)
       python Tools/wowsrc.py --check [--report report.md] [--github-output $GITHUB_OUTPUT]
