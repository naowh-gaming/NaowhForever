"""Checks that every file the TOCs load exists, with the same letter case.

The game only reports a missing file as an error at login, and a path whose case differs
works on one machine and fails on another. Follows the XML files the TOC includes (see
toc_files.py), so a module's own load file is checked too. The libraries' files that
Libs/embeds.xml lists are not in git (the packager fetches them, see .pkgmeta), so they are
left to check-package.sh, which checks the built package. Run from the repo root.
