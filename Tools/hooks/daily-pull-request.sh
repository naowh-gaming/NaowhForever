#!/usr/bin/env bash
# The daily watch's one pull request (.github/workflows/daily-watch.yml). Its checks run one
# after another on one branch; each that changed something adds it:
#   bash Tools/hooks/daily-pull-request.sh add NAME SHORT REPORT CHANGELOG PATH...
# commits what changed under the paths, for a check that fails after it to go back to, and
# notes SHORT (what it is, a few words for the title), CHANGELOG (its lines for players, one per
# line, each starting Added:, Changed: or Fixed:, for "## Changelog" in the description; empty
# for none), its lines for the list (CHANGELOG's, else SHORT) and REPORT (for the description).
# CHANGELOG.md is left alone: the release copies the description's lines into it. A check adds
# only when it found a change, so nothing changed under the paths means CI could not make it
# (it may not read Wowhead): that is noted as stuck, for the issue below.
#   bash Tools/hooks/daily-pull-request.sh hold REASON_FILE
# keeps the pull request a draft, REASON_FILE's text at the top of its description: what must
# be done on our machines before it can be merged (a BiS pick CI could not find a source for).
#   bash Tools/hooks/daily-pull-request.sh open BRANCH
# squashes what was added into one commit (it is merged as one: its title and short list are
# the squash's message), pushes BRANCH and opens the pull request, or brings the one already
# open up to date, labelled "no changelog" when no check has a line for players. Where the
# organization does not let workflows open pull requests, one issue with a link that opens it
# in one click, kept up to date. Nothing added: nothing.
# Either way, what is stuck goes in one issue, "Daily data: changes that need a run on our
# machines" (each check's report, and what to run), kept up to date and closed by the first
# run with nothing stuck.
# Needs BASE (the commit the run started from) and, for open, GH_TOKEN, REPO, SERVER, RUN_ID.
