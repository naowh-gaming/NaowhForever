"""Build the Training Planner's spell list from Wowhead Forever's class ability lists.

Each class's list (wowhead.com/forever/spells/abilities/<class>) gives every spell with its
level, rank, where it comes from (source 6 is a trainer, 4 a quest) and the trainer's base
price in copper. Kept: the spells a trainer sells, and the ones a quest teaches above level 1.
Left out: talents (no trainer), runes and engravings, the level 60 book ranks, and the hunter's
pet training (rows with no skill line: the pet learns those, not the hunter).

Rogue poisons are not in the rogue's list: they are the game's Poisons skill line
(SkillLineAbility), each with its level from its own Wowhead page, kept when that page lists
a trainer teaching it (the first Instant Poison, which the skill grants, and the book and
rune poisons are not). Their price comes from the trainer window. Pick Lock, Parry, Dual
Wield and the armor skills are left out: Wowhead gives them level 1 for every class, which
the trainers do not.

From the game's own tables (Tools/wago.py): each later rank's talent, when its first rank is a
talent (Talent: the talent's first rank, by class and spell name), so the addon can list those
ranks once the talent is known. On Forever some talents are sold by the trainer too (Aimed
Shot, Holy Shock); then nothing waits on the talent.

Wowhead's answers are kept in Tools/training_cache.json; delete a class's entry to ask again.

Writes Training/NaowhForever_TrainingData.lua.

Usage: python Tools/build_training.py [--build 1.60.1.70170]
