"""Tells whether a newer WoW Forever build is out than the one the Journal's data is read
from (wago.BUILD), and what it changes for the Journal. Run daily by
.github/workflows/daily-watch.yml, which opens a pull request when there is one.

What it checks, between the build in use and the new one (the game's own tables, through
wago.tools; nothing is read from Wowhead, the report only links to it):

- Faction rewards: each reward of the Journal's factions that is new, gone, or changed (its
  standing, price, item level, required level or quality), by name.
- Hotfixes: they are recorded per build, and wago.tools records a new build's only some time
  after it appears: until then the new build lacks the items added by hotfix (the Darkspear
  Raiders' and Theramore's). How far it has them is measured (wago.hotfix_coverage: the
  share of the items our data's builds got by hotfix that it has). Under wago.CAUGHT_UP, the
  build in use's are carried over (wago.CARRY_FROM; a hotfix stays in the game until
  Blizzard takes it back) and listed, and a reward even that cannot keep makes the build
  wait, unless --allow-losses. At CAUGHT_UP or more, the build stands alone: a reward it
  lacks was removed by Blizzard, and is dropped and listed.
- Its own hotfixes coming in: with nothing newer out, while the build in use still carries
  items over, the same measure tells when wago.tools has recorded its own hotfixes; then the
  data is rebuilt from them alone (what is still missing was removed by Blizzard).
- Kill counts: every encounter ID a boss in DungeonJournal/Data/Dungeons is counted by,
  that the build in use has, is still in the new build's DungeonEncounter table. One that is
  gone stops counting kills. (A few are pinned by hand in journal_bosses.json, for a raid
  the table does not have yet; those are only counted.)
- New encounters on the maps of the Journal's dungeons: a boss the Journal may be missing.
- New dungeon and raid maps: a dungeon the Journal does not have yet.
- New dungeon floor maps: the game's own map of a dungeon's inside (UiMap type 4), which
  Forever has none of yet: the Journal's dungeon maps draw the old world map's art, and the
  dungeons new in Forever have none. Information only.
- New gear: uncommon or better items the new build adds that can be worn or wielded, and the
  Journal does not list yet. The game's tables cannot say who drops an item (loot is the
  server's), so these are for a person to place under their bosses. Information only: it
  never holds a build back.

A build wago has only just added may not be readable yet (it has to learn each table's
layout first): then the report says so, ready is false, and the next day's run tries again.

Writes a Markdown report to stdout (or --report): a verdict and a summary table, then what
changes for players, then the checks. With --update, makes the change: sets wago.BUILD and
CARRY_FROM, rebuilds the faction data, and adds a line for players under "## Unreleased" in
CHANGELOG.md (a new build always has one; its own hotfixes coming in, when they change
something). With --github-output, writes the workflow's step outputs: newer, ready, build,
problems, made (a change to open a pull request for), changelog (it has a changelog line),
branch, title and issue (the issue's title, where the workflow may not open the PR).

Usage: python Tools/watch_build.py [--build 1.60.1.12345] [--force] [--update] [--allow-losses]
