"""Build the town map's zone exit arrows: where the roads cross from one zone into the next.

Forever has no map link data (C_Map.GetMapLinksForMap returns nothing), so the exits are made
here. Where a road crosses a zone's border was read off the game's map art by eye, and is
written by hand (EXITS), as a map percentage near the crossing. The rest comes from data:

- Which zone owns each spot in the world is Wowhead's zone grid for Forever (from its world
  map's data, a cell about 33 yards across, the game's own areas), turned into uiMapIDs with
  the game's UiMapAssignment (wago.tools), which also places each map's percentages in the
  world.
- Each pick is moved onto the nearest spot of its zone that touches another, the arrow faces
  away from its zone and sits a step inside it, and the road leads to the zone it faces into.
- The other side of each road gets its own arrow, unless that zone lists its roads to this one.

A city gate is written with its city and the arrow's bearing (degrees, 0 north,
anticlockwise), and placed as written: a city sits inside its zone on the grid. Where three
zones meet, an exit names its neighbour to settle which.
