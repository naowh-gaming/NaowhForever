"""Build the Dungeon Journal's data from Tools/data/journal_bosses.json, Wowhead and wowsrc.com.

The boss lists are kept by hand in journal_bosses.json (bosses, rares, optional bosses and
loot chests, per wing; "quest" names those of a wing's bosses there only for a quest, kept in
kill order with no number, as Highland Horror). For each boss this finds its NPC on Wowhead
Forever by name and reads the "drops" list on its page (a chest: its object page's
"contains"): every item with the number of kills it dropped from. Where Wowhead Forever keeps nothing (it has not loaded
every classic item yet), Wowhead Classic's page for the same NPC is read. Gear of uncommon
quality or better is kept when it drops from at least 1 in 100 kills and is not a world drop
(the random greens any mob of that level carries). Wowhead counts Classic Era's kills and
Forever's together, so an item new in Forever looks rarer than it is: it is kept once it
has dropped twice, with no chance shown. A boss new in Forever has only Forever's kills, so
its chances are real; under 10 kills none is shown.

Then wowsrc.com's Forever loot pages (Tools/sources/wowsrc.py, its own data file) say what each
boss drops in Forever: their items are added, their chances win, and an old item they no
longer list on that boss is dropped (moved, like Springvale's lantern, now trash's). Each
wing's trash comes from them too. Last, the items placed by hand ("add") and the BiS
sources in NaowhForever_BiS/BiS/Data/BiS.lua; those have no chance.

Every item is listed, the ones not in Forever yet too, so the Journal is whole the day they
come. An item is in the game (known) when the game's tables have it (wago.tools' ItemSparse,
hotfixes in) or the game sent it (Tools/data/items_in_game.json, read from a client by
Tools/sources/items_in_game.py); else it is not in Forever yet, and Data/Items.lua carries all the
Journal shows of it (its name, quality, levels, icon) from Classic Era's tables
(CLASSIC_ERA), so the client never asks the server for it. One Classic Era does not have
either is left out, and listed at the end.
A new Forever item Wowhead ties to SHARED_DROP or more bosses, and wowsrc to none of them, is a
shared random drop, not any one boss's: it is left out. On a boss new in Forever, an item
Wowhead flags as a world drop is the boss's own when it drops from WORLD_DROP_BOSS percent of
its kills or more (Spiritwraith Drape, Faldrim Anvilmar's).

A dungeon is open when the game's own tables (not items_in_game.json: an item the server
sends on request does not open its dungeon) have at least OPEN_SHARE of its instance's boss
loot (Scarlet Monastery's four wings are one instance), or "open" in journal_bosses.json says
so; one not open says so at the top of its page (closed). A boss new in Forever whose drops
were read from fewer than MIN_KILLS kills is read again on a run that asks Wowhead.

Each dungeon also gets the zone its entrance is in and that zone's territory (Alliance, Horde
or Contested) from Wowhead Forever's zone list, and the entrance itself where
journal_bosses.json has one.

Each boss gets its encounter IDs, what ENCOUNTER_END names it by (the Journal counts kills
with it): the game's DungeonEncounter table for the Forever build, from wago.tools' export,
joined on the dungeon's instance (its map in Data/Quests.lua, else the Map table by name) and
the boss's name, or its encounterNames entry in journal_bosses.json. Every row of the
5-player dungeon counts: difficulty 0 fires on any, and Forever has two "Normal"s, 1 and
201, with their own rows in some dungeons. The first ID listed is the one kills are saved
under. A rare, or a boss fought inside a shared encounter (the Ring of Law), has none.

Writes one file per dungeon, NaowhForever_DungeonJournal/Data/Dungeons/<Key>.lua, and
NaowhForever_DungeonJournal/Data/Items.lua with what the addon needs to know about each item before
the client has loaded it; a new dungeon's file also goes in NaowhForever_DungeonJournal/DungeonJournal.xml. Answers are cached in journal_cache.json; delete an
entry to fetch it again.

Raids are in the same list with "raid" (how many players) and "announced": only the
raids announced for Forever get a file, so a classic raid waits in journal_bosses.json until
Blizzard announces it. A dungeon's "note" is shown at the top of its page, "loot": false leaves its loot out (a
raid whose drops Wowhead has no Forever data for yet: its page only has world drops), and
"encounterIDs" pins a boss's encounter IDs where the game's table hides its row.
"countedWith" names, for a boss the game runs no fight for, the boss whose fight it falls in
(Sneed's Shredder, which Sneed climbs out of): it takes that fight's encounter IDs, so its
kills count with it, and says so ("with").

--offline (the daily watch, in CI) asks Wowhead nothing: what the cache does not have comes
from the game's own tables where they have it (a new item's facts, through Tools/sources/wago.py),
else is left out and listed at the end, for a run on our machines.
