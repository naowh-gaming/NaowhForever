"""Fits the Naowh Score's constants (NaowhForever_BiS/NaowhScore/Data/Formula.lua) to a WoW Forever build's own
item table, read through wago.tools. Run by .github/workflows/daily-watch.yml when the watch
moves to a new build (and on manual runs, as a report), so the score follows the game.

How the game gives an item its stats (the columns read, in COLUMNS):

- ItemSparse: ItemLevel, OverallQualityID, InventoryType, Display_lang (to skip test items),
  and ten stats: StatModifier_bonusStat_N (the stat's type: 3 agility, 4 strength, 5
  intellect, 6 spirit, 7 stamina, 31 hit, 32 crit, 45 spell power, ...) with
  StatPercentEditor_N (its share of the item's budget, in 1/10000ths).
- RandPropPoints: by item level, the budget for each quality (Good_K, Superior_K, Epic_K)
  and slot kind K (0 head, chest, legs, two-hander; 1 shoulders, waist, feet, hands,
  trinket; 2 neck, wrist, finger, back, shield, held in off hand; 3 one-hander; 4 ranged).
  A stat's amount is its share x that budget / 10000, rounded: what the tooltip shows.
- ItemDamageOneHand: a one-hander's DPS by item level and quality (Quality_0 to Quality_2):
  how much a grey and a white weapon are worth next to a green.

The method, the same as the first fit's (which read Wowhead's database; CI reads only the
game's tables):

1. An item's stat budget: (sum (cost x stat)^1.5)^(1/1.5), primary stats costing 1 and every
   other stat's cost fitted (dodge, parry, block and expertise share one; so do resistances).
2. The budget against slot multiplier x (a_q x item level + c_q), one line per quality
   (green, blue, epic, the epic one through 0), by robust least squares (soft L1) on its log.
   Items of item level 5 to 100 with stats; the ones with a stat the model does not price
   (school spell damage, weapon skill, profession bonuses, slaying) are left out.
3. SLOTS: the slot multipliers (chest = 1), rounded to 2 places. Trinkets keep 0.7, a
   judgement call: their power is mostly in effects no stat shows.
4. SCALE and SHIFT: each quality's line in epic item levels (a_q / a_epic, c_q / a_epic),
   SCALE rounded to 2 places and SHIFT to 1. Grey and white carry no stats: the green line
   times their weapon DPS share of a green's (the mean over item levels 5 to 60). Legendary,
   artifact and heirloom count as epic.

It is deterministic: the same tables give the same constants. The report's 95% intervals
come from a bootstrap with a fixed seed, and only the report shows them.

Quality gates (any failing: the constants stay as they are, and the report says why): a full
epic set of level L scores L; the fitted model explains at least 90% of the items' budgets
(R^2 on the log, trinkets aside); the slots rank sensibly (head, chest and legs at least
shoulders, hands, waist and feet, which are at least neck, wrists, rings and back; a
two-hander within 0.1 of a main and off hand); and at item level 20, 40 and 60 grey < white
< green < blue < epic.

Change gate: Formula.lua is rewritten only when a slot weight moves 0.02 or more, or a
quality's worth at item level 60 (60 x SCALE + SHIFT) moves 0.5 or more.
