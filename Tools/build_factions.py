"""Build the Dungeon Journal's factions from Tools/journal_factions.json and the game's own
tables (Tools/wago.py).

Every item that needs a standing with a faction says so in the game's item table
(ItemSparse: MinFactionID, MinReputation, 0 Hated to 7 Exalted, one below the game's
reaction), with its price at a vendor (BuyPrice, in copper), quality, item level and
required level; the Item table gives its class and subclass. Hotfixes are applied: the
items added since the build was cut are only there. A faction's rewards are the items that
need a standing with it, all but grey ones (the tables keep a few grey test items). Nothing
is read from Wowhead.

By hand, on top: a faction's "add" list in journal_factions.json adds rewards the game's
tables do not have yet (announced, or on the test realm), and its "remove" list drops ones
that are wrong. An added item is written like this, standing by its name and price in coins
(both price and note can be left out):

    "add": [
        { "item": 272063, "standing": "Honored", "price": "9g 1s 14c", "note": "on the PTR" }
    ],
    "remove": [ 4996 ]

What the game's tables know about an added item (its quality, level, class) is used where
they have the item at all.

Hotfixes carried over: an item the build's tables lack entirely is taken from the tables of
wago.CARRY_FROM, the build before, with its hotfixes (see Tools/wago.py). An item the build
has, the build's own row wins. Once they list it as this faction's reward, theirs win, and the
build says its hand-written line can go.

Writes one file per faction, NaowhForever_DungeonJournal/Data/Factions/<Key>.lua,
Shared/Data/FactionItems.lua with what the Journal needs to know about each reward
before the client has loaded it, and NaowhForever_DungeonJournal/Data/Build.lua: the build the data is
read from and when it came out, shown by the Journal's title.
