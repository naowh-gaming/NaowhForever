# Shared

What every module can use, so they look and work the same from one copy of the code. The
Dungeon Journal and the BiS List are built on it. Loads after Core and before every module,
through `Shared.xml`. Nothing is made or listened to at load.

## Layout

```
Shared/
  Shared.xml       what loads, in order (the core TOC's Shared load point)
  Shared.lua       the namespace (ns.Shared), what a character keeps by its GUID (Shared.CharacterData),
                   and how long ago a time was (Shared.Ago)
  Style.lua        the house look: colors (BiS stars, worn green, looks, red and warning orange), icons, sizes
  Data/            data only, generated; never edited by hand
    Forever.lua      what is new in WoW Forever, by ID (Shared.ForeverNew), from Tools/build/forever_new.py
    ItemFacts.lua    each dungeon item's class, subclass, item level, required level and quality before the
                     client loads it (Shared.ItemFacts), from Tools/build/journal.py: the Journal's loot,
                     the BiS List's levels and the Naowh Score's best read it
    FactionItems.lua the same for the factions' rewards, added to it, from Tools/build/factions.py
  Decode.lua       a pasted import string read back as plain data, with size, depth and bomb caps, and
                   outside text cleaned for display (Decode.String, Decode.Text)
  Game/Items.lua   item helpers: an ID from a link or URL, its name and quality color, In Bag and In Bank,
                   your loot lines, waiting on item data, the items the server would not send
  Game/Gear.lua    gear helpers on Shared.Items: gear slots, what fits where, what you wear, weapons in
                   short ("1h Sword"), what a class can use (ns.ClassCanUse)
  Game/Bags.lua    the item buttons in your bags, the game's and EllesmereUI's, for the marks
                   painted on them (Bag Marks, Scrap Marker)
  Game/Consumables.lua your best food and drink in your bags (ns.BestFoodAndDrink), and the healthstones and
                   healing potions, best first (ns.HEALTHSTONES, ns.HEALING_POTIONS): QoL's Food & Drink
                   Bar, the Macros' NF Food and NF Health, and Aura Buffs' low health reminder
  Game/Roster.lua  our part of a player's tooltip in the Guild & Communities and Friends lists (Badges, Naowh Score)
  Game/Places.lua  zones by name, and showing one on the world map
  Game/Towns.lua   town service NPCs by world map (ns.TownNPCs) and the capitals (ns.TownCapitals), by hand:
                   QoL's Map Pins, the Training Planner's trainers and Professions' rank alerts read it
  Game/Played.lua  the character's /played time, asked for once with the chat print muted (XP Bar, XP per Hour)
  UI/Parts.lua     the small parts: icons in text (Parts.Inline), smooth textures, hover cards (Parts.Tip,
                   Parts.TipLines), the chevron, links, icon buttons, a short label in a pill of its color
                   (Parts.Pill, Parts.SetPill: Group Inspect's "NF"), the worn bar, the Wowhead copy card
  UI/Marks.lua     an item's marks: rank stars and lines, the upgrade line, Forever's mark, the item icon,
                   its slot marks (item level, star, Forever's mark, upgrade arrow) and an atlas badge on
                   its top corner (Parts.ItemBadge: Bag Space's clock and quest "!"), and a class icon's
                   crop (Parts.ClassCrop)
  UI/Text.lua      text made once and kept: counts ("3/10"), money with its coins (Parts.Coins; compact,
                   its largest coin only), plain where-lines, numbers lined up to the pixel (Parts.Cells),
                   and a row of labels packed or spread evenly (Parts.LabelRow)
  UI/Hud.lua       the HUD look: a HUD line's shadow, font, size and outline (Parts.HudText, Parts.HudFont, Parts.HudFlags),
                   a HUD card's background: the card, a soft fade or none (Parts.HudBackdrop), a window's
                   soft drop shadow (Parts.Shadow), and a progress line that holds still (Parts.ProgressLine)
  UI/Timer.lua     a timer line the client runs down by itself (Parts.TimerLine), its short time text
                   (Parts.ShortTime), and stopping any timer bar (Parts.StopTimer)
  UI/Share.lua     sharing a line in chat or on a copy card (Parts.ShareMenu), and a spot on the map with
                   its pin link (Parts.SharePlace)
  UI/CopyCard.lua  the copy cards: an ID with its Wowhead links (ns.ShowCopyCard), or any line
                   (ns.ShowCopyLine)
  UI/Panels.lua    a window's backdrop and its cards (Parts.Backdrop), the panel a view sits in, and the
                   side panel that opens beside a window
  UI/Window.lua    a window: the frame, its size grip, the title bar with its logo, icons and opacity
                   slider, the link back to the window it was opened from, and the footer; on the
                   Classic+ skin its trim (Parts.ClassicTrim), title plate (Parts.TitlePlate) and a
                   box's bronze line (Parts.ClassicBox)
  UI/Forever.lua   the Forever skin's parts, each on the game's own art with a drawn fallback: the window
                   frame with its title bar, portrait and red close (Parts.ForeverFrame), insets, buttons,
                   fields, the search box, tabs, side tabs, check boxes, dropdowns, sliders, swatches, the
                   help tip, list bars, title plaques, row bands, scroll chevrons, and the options
                   window's header band and bronze rails (Parts.ForeverPanes)
  UI/Tabs.lua      a switch of parts side by side (Parts.Tabs), and a search box (Parts.SearchBox)
  UI/SettingsCard.lua a module's card at the top of its settings page: the logo, a line or two, and the
                   button that opens its window
  UI/Tracker.lua   a tracker's small window (Parts.TrackerPanel), and a list row's bands
                   (Parts.RowBands: stripe, hover, the line under it)
  View/View.lua    the row engine: pooled rows, cards, the card grid, one redraw per burst
  View/Kinds.lua   the rows every page has: section title (shorter with view.tightTitles), note, card, and
                   an item in a list you keep (icon, name in its quality color, a line under it, a tag, a
                   value, an X)
  Settings/
    Settings.lua   every settings page, declared once: pages, cards, rows, what changed, reset, search index
    Style.lua      the numbers a settings page's controls, rows and page share (Settings.Style)
    Controls.lua   the control on a row for each kind of setting, made once per row (Settings.Control)
    Rows.lua       a settings page's row kinds: a setting, a card's head and foot, a group, an info line,
                   a window card (Settings.kinds)
    Page.lua       a declared page drawn on the row engine: cards, their heads, two-column rows
    Studio.lua     a card's live preview: a stage and the moments it can be seen in
    EditZone.lua   a part of a preview made editable by drag, wheel, click and right-click
```

Each file uses only the ones above it in `Shared.xml`. Every part sits on `ns.Shared.Parts`
(`Parts`), whichever file makes it, so a module never needs to know which file that is.

## Using it

- **A look:** make your module's `Style` with `setmetatable({ ... }, { __index = ns.Shared.Style })`.
  Put only your own values in it; the house ones come through.
- **A page:** `local kinds = ns.Shared.View.NewKinds()`, add your row kinds to it
  (`New(view)` makes the frame once, `Set(row, ...)` fills it and returns its height), then
  `ns.Shared.View.New(parent, kinds, mixin)`. Your mixin draws: `self:Clear()`, `self:Add(...)`
  rows, `self:Fit(events)`, and `Redraw()` draws again.
- **Settings:** a module declares its settings next to its code, on the page they show on:
  `ns.Shared.Settings.Page("QoL/General", S):Card({ id, name, help, switch, summary, order,
  studio, rows = { ... } })`, rows like `{ key = "iconSize", label = "Icon Size", slider = { 12,
  32, 1 } }` and `Settings.Group("Clock")` between them (see `Settings/Settings.lua`). A
  row with `field` (and its own `get`/`set`) is one entry of a table setting `key`, with its own dot
  and reset (AuraBuffs' raid buff switches). A row or
  group with `hidden` is left off the page: `true` for one set on the preview instead, or a
  function, so rows for one choice only (the Campfire's Round and Simple rows) show with it. A
  row's `cog = { title, tip }` puts a cog left of its control, opening a small panel of the rows
  declared `under` that row's label: hidden rows, still searched, counted and reset with the
  card, and a search hit on one opens the cog. `icons = { { texture, tip, open, enabled }, ... }`
  adds other icons beside it. A card's `watch = { store, ... }` draws it again when another
  module's settings change too. A card's or row's `search = "..."` adds words the settings
  search finds but nothing shows, for clicks and slash commands too small for its help. The page
  in the options window, its search entries, the dot on what you changed and each card's reset
  all come from that one declaration. Settings pages hold settings only: a module's lists and
  editors live in its own window, opened from the page's `page:Window{ ... }` card (first on
  the page, or where its `order` puts it). A card that
  shows something on screen can carry a live preview (`studio`, see `Settings/Studio.lua`; its
  `height` a number, or a function for a stage that changes with a setting),
  drawn by the module's own drawing code on plain frames, never on its real (secure) frames.
  `Settings.EditZone(parent, opts)` (`Settings/EditZone.lua`) makes part of a preview editable, every option optional:
  `click(zone)`, `menu(owner, root)` (the house context menu on right-click), `wheel(zone, delta)`,
  `drag = { get, set, live, range, axis, factor }` (a drag along `axis`, "x" by default, snapped to
  `range` `{ low, high, step }` with `Settings.Snap`, drawn through `live` and saved through `set`
  on release), and a hover mark: `wash` (a faint fill) or `edge` (an accent line down its middle).
  Nothing runs per frame except while dragging. The Campfire's Simple bar preview uses it.
- **A window:** `Parts.Window`, `Parts.TitleBar`, `Parts.Opacity`, `Parts.BarButton`,
  `Parts.Logo` (the title bar's logo alone, opening a settings page), `Parts.FooterBrand`, `Parts.Resizable(window, sizeKey, minW, minH, onSized, onReleased)` (a corner
  grip; the size is kept; `onSized` and `onReleased`, run as the grip is let go, are optional). See
  `NaowhForever_BiS/BiS/UI/Window.lua` for a short one.
- **A tracker:** `Parts.TrackerPanel(title, opts)` builds a tracker's window once, on first
  use: the window look, the title (click and drag), a scrolling body, a cog, its place kept.
  Every option is optional:

  | Option | What it adds |
  | --- | --- |
  | `width` | starting width (`TRACKER_W`) |
  | `titleRoom` | room left of the close button for your own buttons |
  | `onTitle`, `titleTip`, `titleHint` | a click on the title, and its tooltip |
  | `onClose` | the close button's click, in place of hiding it |
  | `bar` | a progress bar under the title: `panel.bar`, with `bar.bg` (`TRACKER_BAR_RGB`) and `bar.text` |
  | `picker = { values, order, get, set, menuHeight }` | a dropdown under the title or bar: `panel.picker` |
  | `newBody(scroll)` | what scrolls in the body (a row engine view); else a plain frame for `panel:SetRows` |
  | `settings = { page, card, tip, hint }` | the cog in the bottom right, opening that settings page and card |
  | `opacity()` | its Window Opacity, for `panel:Paint()` |
  | `load()`, `save(point, relativePoint, x, y)`, `place` | its place: read, saved on drag, and the default `{ point, relativePoint, x, y }` |
  | `mover(panel, onMoved)` | Unlock Mode's mover: return `ns.UI.AttachMover(panel, label, onMoved, page)`; it saves through `save` |
  | `maxHeight()` | taller than this, its body scrolls |

  The panel has `panel:Paint()`, `panel:Place()`, `panel:SetTrackerWidth(w)`,
  `panel:Fit(bodyHeight)` (true when it starts or stops scrolling: set its width again and
  redraw), `panel:ScrollGap()`, `panel:Top()` and `panel:SetRows(entries)`: pooled rows of
  `{ text, sub, color, done, waypoint(entry), tip(row), click(row, button) }`, a pin column (a
  tick once done), the text in `color` (`T.fg` when nil), returning their height. Keep the
  entries and refill them, with shared functions that read the entry, and a redraw makes no
  garbage. See `NaowhForever_DungeonJournal/UI/QuestTracker.lua`, and the Discovery trackers for `bar`,
  `SetRows` and `mover`.
- **A HUD panel:** an on-screen bar or pill uses the windows' own backdrop, `Parts.Backdrop(frame)`
  painted at `Style.BACKDROP_ALPHA` (near opaque, so the world does not tint it), with the 1px black
  edge (`Style.BORDER_RGB`). The Campfire's Simple bar is one: its words are panel text (no HUD
  shadow), an amount in the text colour before its muted stat, and the accent only on a key word.
- **A timer line:** `Parts.TimerLine(parent, height, text)` is a thin StatusBar the client runs
  down by itself (`SetTimerDuration`), so no Lua runs while it counts: a full-width track in the
  theme's line color, a fill in a gradient into its color, and a soft glow where the fill ends.
  Give it a FontString as `text` (optional) and the time left is written into it the same way,
  short (`35s`, `42m`, `1h`: `Parts.ShortTime(prefix)`, one formatter per prefix, made once).
  `line:Run(start, duration, prefix)` starts it (`prefix` optional, e.g. `"in "`), `line:Stop()`
  empties it, and `line:Paint(color, textColor)` colors the fill and the glow, and the text in
  `textColor` when given, else in `color`. The Campfire's Simple bar uses it, in
  `Style.TIME_OK_RGB`, `TIME_LOW_RGB` and `TIME_OUT_RGB` (plenty, running low, nearly out).
- **Labels in a row:** `Parts.LabelRow(parent, size, flags, color, opts)` (all but `parent` and
  `size` optional) makes a frame of pooled labels. `row:SetLabels(list, n, icons)` writes the first
  `n` strings of `list` and returns the widest; `row:Pack()` lines them up left to right and
  returns the width, `row:Spread(width)` centres each in an equal share of `width` instead;
  `row:SetColor(color)` and `row:SetTextSize(size)` restyle them. `opts`: `gap` (space between
  labels as they are packed), `separator` (text between labels, e.g. `Style.PLACE_DOT`) in
  `separatorColor` (muted by default), and an item icon before each label (`Parts.ItemIcon`, the
  house edge) sized `icon`, or `iconGrow` more than the text, `iconGap` from it and `iconDrop`
  lower; `icons[i]` is its texture, false for none. Anchor the row by its left edge.
  Refilling it with the same strings makes no garbage.
- **Copying:** `Parts.CopyWowhead(kind, id, name)` opens the copy card on an item, quest or
  NPC's Wowhead link; a menu's Copy uses `ns.ShowCopyLine(title, text, icon)` (`CopyCard.lua`)
  for any line. `ns.ShowCopyCard(kind, label, id, title, mode, onClose)` opens the ID card itself.
- **Text on the game world:** `Parts.HudText(fontString, shadow)` gives a HUD line (the XP
  Ticker, an alert) the house look: no outline, a soft drop shadow (`HUD_SHADOW_RGB`,
  `HUD_SHADOW_ALPHA`, `HUD_SHADOW_X`, `HUD_SHADOW_Y` in `Style.lua`). Pass `shadow` false to
  take it off, for text a player chose to outline, or a background mode (`"soft"`, `"none"`) for
  the stronger shadow text needs over the world (`HUD_SOFT_SHADOW_ALPHA`, `HUD_BARE_SHADOW_*`).
  It returns the font string. A HUD card (the Flight Timer, the XP Ticker) puts it on the theme's
  background at `HUD_CARD_ALPHA` with the 1px black border, so the text needs no outline; its
  icons are `PLAY`, `PAUSE` and `RESET`.
- **A HUD card's background:** `Parts.HudBackdrop(frame, opts)` gives a HUD card the background a
  player picks: `backdrop:SetMode(mode)` with `"card"`, `"soft"` or `"none"` (anything else is
  `"card"`) returns the mode, and the same one again does nothing. Card is the theme's background
  at `HUD_CARD_ALPHA` with the 1px black edge (`backdrop.fill`, `backdrop.border`). Soft has no
  edge: a fade in the theme's background, `HUD_SOFT_ALPHA` behind the text and clear
  `HUD_SOFT_FADE` further out, `HUD_SOFT_INSET` of it inside the frame. It is nine pieces of one
  round texture (`Style.SOFT_SHADE`, from `Tools/media/make_media.py`), so its corners are round and no
  edge shows, made the first time Soft is picked (`backdrop.soft`). None shows nothing. `opts`, all
  optional: `alpha` (the card's fill), `color` (`T.bg`), `softAlpha`, `fade`, `inset` and `mode`.
  Pass the mode to `Parts.HudText` for each line on it; the choice row's values are
  `Parts.HUD_BACKGROUNDS`. The XP Ticker and Bag Space use it.
- **A HUD element's look:** every on-screen element offers the same Text, Bar and Background rows,
  declared with `Settings.Look(prefix, opts)` as one entry of a card's `rows` (a card takes a list
  of rows in place). Its keys are `<prefix>Font`, `<prefix>FontSize`, `<prefix>Outline`,
  `<prefix>Texture`, and `<prefix>Background` (card/soft/none) or `<prefix>BgAlpha`; with the
  prefix `""` they are `font`, `fontSize` and so on. `opts`: `text`, `size` (the font size
  slider's range), `bar` (the name the element's own texture shows under), `background` (`"card"`
  or `"alpha"`), `needs` and `why` for every row, and `keys`, which maps a suffix to a key the
  element already saves under (`{ FontSize = "textSize" }`) or to false to leave the row out. The
  defaults stay in the module's `UI.ModuleSettings`, at today's look (`outline = "OUTLINE"` for
  outlined text, `""` for the rest). To draw it, `Parts.HudFont(fs, font, size, outline,
  background)` sets the font (a SharedMedia name, `""` for the Addon Font), size and outline (one
  of `Parts.HUD_OUTLINES`: `"NONE"` plain text, `""` Shadow, `"OUTLINE"`, `"THICKOUTLINE"`) and gives
  Shadow the HUD shadow for its `background` mode. Text set by hand takes its flags from
  `Parts.HudFlags(outline)`, never the raw choice: the game rejects `"NONE"` as a font flag.
  A bar's texture is `ns.UI.TexturePath(name, own)`: the
  SharedMedia statusbar, or `own` for `""` and anything missing. A row of its own uses the
  `texture` kind, `{ key = "texture", label = "Bar Texture", texture = "Flat" }`, which lists
  `ns.UI.TextureChoices`. The Swing Timer and Threat Meter use it.
- **A window's shadow:** `Parts.Shadow(frame, size, alpha)` puts a soft drop shadow round a
  window, outside it only, so a see-through window shows none of it: Soft's pieces without the
  middle, in black from `alpha` (`SHADOW_ALPHA`) at the edge to clear `size` (`SHADOW_SIZE`) out.
  It returns the textures. The options window uses it.
- **A progress line:** `Parts.ProgressLine(parent, height)` is a thin line that holds still (the
  XP Ticker's level progress): a track in the theme's line color, a fill in a gradient into its
  color, and a fainter segment ahead of the fill (rested XP). `line:SetProgress(value, ahead)`
  takes shares of the whole (0 to 1), and `line:Paint(color, aheadColor)` colors them. Anchor it
  where it goes; it sizes with its anchors, so a card that grows needs no redraw. `line.track` is
  the track, hidden where no card is behind it.
- **Played time:** `ns.Shared.Played`. `Played.Want(key)` (one key per module) listens and asks
  for /played once, with the chat print muted for that request only; `Played.Drop(key)` stops
  listening once nobody wants it. `Played.Total()` and `Played.Level()` are the running seconds, nil
  before the answer; a ding starts the level's time again. Hook `Played.Answered(total, level)` and
  `Played.LeveledUp(level, total)` with `hooksecurefunc` to hear the answer and each ding. A /played
  the player types updates it too. The XP Bar and XP per Hour use it.
- **Forever's mark:** `Parts.IsForever(kind, id)` says whether Wowhead's Forever database has
  it as new in Forever (`Data/Forever.lua`, generated by `Tools/build/forever_new.py`; do not
  edit by hand).

## The rule: always use these

Every module builds its UI from these components and the `ns.UI` widgets, never its own copy.

- **It exists:** use it as it is.
- **It almost fits:** make it more flexible. Add an optional input (a parameter or an options
  field) that leaves every current caller working as before, rather than copying it.
- **Nothing fits:** add a new component here, list it above, and use it from your module.
  Anything another module could want belongs here, not inside one module.

Colors and sizes come from `ns.THEME` and `Style.lua`, never written as numbers in a module.

## Why

What a comment in the code used to say, in short. The house rules behind it are in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [STYLE.md](../.github/STYLE.md).

### Loading and saved data

- Nothing is made, hooked or listened to at load: a module builds what it uses the first time
  it shows it, so Shared costs nothing for a feature that is off.
- `Shared.CharacterData` keys a character's data by its GUID: first names are not unique on
  Forever, so a name key collides. It returns nil before the game knows who you are.
- `Decode.lua` loads with nothing else from the addon and returns its table, so the offline
  tests can load it on its own.

### The look (`Style.lua`)

- A name ends in what it holds: `_CODE` is a color escape (`"|cffb06bff"`), `_RGB` a `{ r, g, b }`
  table (0 to 1). Sizes are pixels at the addon's UI scale.
- The theme's own colors (`T.fg`, `T.muted`, `T.accent`) come from the theme, read when a row
  is made, so a theme change shows after a `/reload`.
- Naowh's house style is a 1px black edge round cards, badges, chips, icons, buttons and
  panels; the accent (Naowh blue) marks what is picked.
- Your BiS is legendary orange so it stands apart from blue item names, your second pick
  silver; new looks are cyan, clear of the BiS orange for color-blind eyes too.
- `PICKED_RGB` (a boss picked on a dungeon map) is the game's quest gold until the player picks
  an Accent of their own. `GUIDE_RGB` (the HUD Editor's guides) is amber so it never reads as
  the accent's selection.
- The addon's own icons in `Core/Media/` are white, so they take any color; `Tools/media/make_media.py`
  draws them. `ROUND` is 128px: load it "TRILINEAR" or it is jagged small. `FOREVER` is 32 by 16;
  `ELBOW` is 8 by 8 and drawn at that size.
- HUD text without the card: Soft fades from `HUD_SOFT_ALPHA` behind the text to clear over
  `HUD_SOFT_FADE`, `HUD_SOFT_INSET` of it inside the card's edge, its text shadow at full
  strength. None has no backdrop: the shadow at full strength and as close (1px), since 2px
  doubles small text.
- `TRACKER_BAR_RGB` is behind a tracker's bar until the player changes the theme's panel color.
- `TEXT_SIZE` (12) and `SMALL_SIZE` (11) are the house text sizes: body text, and muted notes.
- `OPEN_TURN` is the quarter turn of a chevron on an open section or card head. It is written
  with `PI`, not `math.pi`: the offline tests load `Style.lua` without the math library.
- The slider ranges every module shares live here: `OPACITY_RANGE` (a window's opacity, from
  `OPACITY_MIN`), `ALPHA_RANGE` (a HUD part's opacity, down to 0), `SCALE_RANGE`,
  `PIN_SIZE_RANGE` (a map pin) and `HUD_TEXT_RANGE` (a HUD part's text size in `Settings.Look`).
  `PERCENT_SCALE` turns a percent slider into the 0 to 1 the setting saves.
- `STAGE_MARGIN`, `STAGE_NOTE_Y` and `STAGE_NOTE_SIZE` place a settings card's live preview and
  the muted note under it.
- `ICON_CROP` (and `ICON_CROP_HIGH`) trims the game's border off an icon. `CLASS_CROP` trims a
  class icon cut from `CLASS_ICONS` (`Parts.ClassCrop`). `TIP_TITLE_RGB` is a tooltip's first line.
- `Style.lua` writes the core's media path out rather than reading `ns.MEDIA`: the offline
  tests load it without `Core/Core.lua`.

### Items and gear

- `Items.KEPT_CODE` is the worn green at 200 of 255 (`KEPT_SHADE`): where you keep an item is a
  state of it, quieter than its name.
- Your loot lines are found by the start of the game's own line (`LOOT_ITEM_SELF`,
  `LOOT_ITEM_PUSHED_SELF`, up to its first `%s`), so it works in any client language. A secret
  line (in an encounter) is nobody's: `issecretvalue` is checked before anything else.
- `Items.OnLoaded` runs its function at most once a frame as the items load. An item the server
  fails to load never calls back, so a ContinuableContainer over them would never finish; an
  item already loaded is not waited on.
- As in classic, mail and plate are learned at level 40 (`HEAVY_ARMOR_LEVEL`): below it a
  hunter, shaman, warrior or paladin wears the lighter armor.
- Weapons in short go by the game's weapon subclass (`Enum.ItemWeaponSubclass`), so any client
  language gets them; one that only goes in one hand says which ("MH Sword", "OH Dagger").
- `Items.ClassCanUse` reads an item's facts as `ItemFacts` holds them: `{ class, subclass, item
  level, required level, quality }`, class 2 a weapon, subclass 0 no armor type, 6 a shield.
- `Items.SlotsFor` returns shared tables: read them, never change them.

### Bags, tooltips, maps and /played

- Bag marks hook each bag frame's `UpdateItems` with `hooksecurefunc`, never `SetScript`, and
  only once a module first asks. EllesmereUI's bags are painted through the
  `RegisterItemOverlayIcon` hook it offers other addons.
- The guild list's tooltip is GameTooltip, so our lines go on it. The Friends list's tooltip has
  fixed lines, so ours is a tooltip of our own `TIP_GAP` under it, which hides itself as soon as
  the Friends tooltip stops showing that row. List rows are hooked with `HookScript`, after the
  game's own, once each. A GUID is used only when it is a readable string, never a secret value.
- `Places.ShowMap` opens the world map only out of combat, where addon code may open it.
- /played is asked for with `TIME_PLAYED_MSG` unregistered from the chat frames for our request
  only. They get it back on the next frame after the answer, so they do not print it, or after
  `MUTE_LIMIT` seconds if no answer comes. A ding starts the level's time again; a /played the
  player types updates it too.

### Parts

- How much lower an icon in text sits, level with the letters: a tooltip's lines need 1
  (`TOOLTIP_DROP`); on a card the Naowh font's capitals fill the middle of the line, so 0
  (`CARD_DROP`). Measured in game, 2 Oct 2026.
- `Parts.Smooth`: a texture drawn smaller than its file stays smooth when it is mipmapped
  ("TRILINEAR", for the addon's own) and never snapped to whole screen pixels, which makes a
  scaled icon's edges step. A text icon (`|T|t`) cannot be smoothed: draw those near their size.
- `Parts.Tip` shows nothing while a menu is open, so moving the mouse from a menu's owner over
  other rows to reach it does not cover the menu with their cards.
- An action on a page is a link, not a box, so the page reads as content; boxes are for a
  window's controls. A link's chevron sits out by its own margin (`LINK_ARROW_OUT`), so its
  point lines up with the text above. A disabled link rests muted and says why on hover.
- An icon button's `margin` is the empty edge on the right of its image: it moves out by it, so
  the shapes, not their boxes, line up.
- The game cannot put text on the clipboard for an addon, so copying opens a copy card with the
  text selected (`Parts.CopyWowhead`, `ns.ShowCopyLine`).
- An item's marks are the same wherever one is drawn (the BiS List's paperdoll, the character
  panel, your bags): item level bottom right, your BiS's star bottom left, Forever's mark top
  left, the game's green upgrade arrow top right, over a shade rising from the foot
  (`SHADE_SHARE` of the icon tall, `SHADE_ALPHA` dark) so the numbers read on any icon's art.
- `MARK_STAR_DROP` is -1: the star 1px over the line's middle sits level with the outlined
  digits across the icon; 2px left it high beside a two-digit level (7 Oct 2026).
- Forever's mark on an icon is `FOREVER_SHARE` of the icon tall, never under `FOREVER_MIN`, with
  no box: its own dark outline keeps it readable on the icon's art.
- The addon's lines in an item's tooltip are one fact each in one look (the mark, the words in
  its color, then after a dot, muted, whose it is), all from the same makers, so the same fact
  never reads two ways, or twice.
- Text that is drawn again and again (counts, ranks, coins, plain lines, Forever marks) is made
  once per value and kept, so a redraw makes no garbage. Coins keep at most `COINS_KEPT`.
- A where line is shown plain: its color codes pull the eye off the titles, and the dash between
  place and person reads as a dot.
- `Parts.Cells`: the Naowh font's digits are not all as wide, so each character gets a cell as
  wide as the widest digit ("-" and "/" narrower), measured once per size.

### HUD, timers and panels

- HUD text has no outline and a soft drop shadow; the Shadow outline gets the HUD shadow for its
  background mode, and a player's own outline gets none.
- Soft is nine pieces of one round texture (`SOFT_SHADE`), so its corners are round and no edge
  shows; they are made the first time Soft is picked. `Parts.Shadow` uses the same pieces without
  the middle, outside the window only, so a see-through window shows none of it.
- A timer line is run down by the client (`SetTimerDuration`) and its time written by a duration
  text binding, so no Lua runs while it counts. The game formats the time, since it can be
  secret. Without those APIs it shows a still bar.
- Short times count seconds up to 90, then minutes up to 90, then hours, each rounded up so a
  time never reads less than is left.
- `Parts.StopTimer`: `SetValue` does not repaint a bar its timer owns, but a duration that has
  already run out (`STOP_AGO` seconds long, started that long ago) leaves it still.
- A window's backdrop paints its opacity into the colors, not with SetAlpha: a texture's alpha
  does not reach a gradient's colors.
- A side panel opens beside the window it was opened from, on whichever side has room, closes
  with it (a `HookScript` on our own window), and opening one closes the others. Its buttons
  share its width with a count of at least 1: the game's Lua stops on a division by zero.
- Sharing never goes through the chat box: opening it from addon code taints it, and the game
  then blocks the next message you send. Say is offered only inside an instance, the one place
  the game lets an addon speak; a dungeon finder group's chat is the instance's.

### Windows

- A window is made hidden: a frame is made shown, and `Show()` on a shown frame runs no OnShow;
  hidden, the first open runs it too, and takes the link back to the window it was opened from.
- A window takes the keyboard only out of combat, where that is allowed, and passes on every key
  but Esc.
- A window's size grip keeps its size account-wide under its `sizeKey`, as the options window's
  is; its place is kept account-wide under `positionKey`.
- A switch's hairlines are made once, when made: its parts are laid out again on a change.
- A module's settings card holds itself in its button's click, made once: `ns.Button` calls its
  click with no arguments.

### The row engine and settings

- A row is sized as it is placed, not only anchored, so wrapped text measures at the right
  width; its top is kept to scroll to it. The view's height is set as it draws, so the furthest
  it can scroll is known before the layout.
- A burst of events makes one redraw (`REDRAW_DELAY`), and none while the view is hidden. An item
  the server refuses (`GET_ITEM_INFO_RECEIVED` with success false) is not waited on again.
- A redraw reuses the row a tooltip belongs to, so it hides the view's own tooltip. The tooltip
  can be on a Blizzard frame the game forbids touching in combat (a nameplate aura): the walk
  stops there, and none of a view's own rows is ever forbidden.
- A card's edge is reset when it is opened: a card last used for a picked one has the accent's.
  An empty card's note stays centered under its header when the grid stretches it.
- A view whose rows sit on bands insets their text (`view.inset`); its section titles line up.
  A section's link passes itself, for a window to open beside what was clicked.
- A settings row with `field` is one entry of a table setting: its dot and reset are that
  entry's own. A number counts as unchanged within `SAME_WITHIN`, so a value saved back through
  a slider or color picker still reads as the default.
- A page's only card opens by itself, as does its first card when it has a live preview. A
  search holds a card open, so its head does not fold it.
- A hidden row is set on the card's preview instead; it is still searched, counted and reset. A
  search match on a hidden row shows the card whole, and part of a card shows no reset, which
  would reset what is left out too.
- A slider being dragged holds the settings redraw until it is let go (`DRAG_WAIT`): the redraw
  hides and shows the rows, and hiding the slider ended its drag after one step.
- A preview is drawn by the module's own drawing code on plain frames, never on its real
  (secure) frames. An edit zone runs nothing per frame except while it is dragged.
- A row's icons (its cog first) are made once per declared row, so drawing them makes no tables.
  A cog whose settings were changed is tinted as a row's dot is.
- A cog opens one shared panel, drawn with the page's own row kinds, so its rows' dots, controls
  and help are the same. A redraw of the page puts it back under the cog. The page's rows hide for
  a moment on every redraw, so the panel closes only once the page itself is gone, a frame later.
- A settings view changed while hidden is marked stale and drawn again as it shows, so it never
  shows an old value (an options window that stepped aside for a picker, a page another changed).

### The Classic+ skin

- The skin is read once per load (`ns.classicSkin`), with the theme's colors, so every part asks it
  as it is made; a change takes a reload.
- A window's frame steps out from its own black edge: a gold line, `CLASSIC_TRIM_BODY` pixels of
  bronze and a black rim, with a gem on each corner. The options window's name sits on a plate
  over its top edge, in the game's title face.
- A window's background is the game's own rock tiled over the backdrop, darkened
  (`CLASSIC_PATTERN_SHADE`) and partly see-through (`CLASSIC_PATTERN_ALPHA`), so text on it stays
  readable.
- Cards and settings heads get a bronze line inside their black edge, the way the game draws its
  option groups (`Parts.ClassicBox`).
- The picked tab is lit bronze under a gold line along its top; the others read in gold.
- The help card is drawn as the game draws its tooltips: dark blue inside a grey-blue line.
- The picked sidebar row is the game's blue list glow, fading to the right
  (`CLASSIC_PICK_ALPHA` to `CLASSIC_PICK_FADE`), with a lit line along its top.
- A button's colors are each state's `{ top, bottom }`; pressed turns them over. A slider is
  filled `{ top, bottom }` too, with a gem to drag on a black edge (`CLASSIC_KNOB_EDGE`).
- The game's tick in a check box is drawn a little larger than the box (`CLASSIC_CHECK_SCALE`), as
  the game draws it.
- Headings stand out as the game's titles do: a size up (`CLASSIC_HEADING_STEP`), on a black drop
  shadow.

### The Forever skin

- The skin is read once per load with the theme's colors, like Classic+: `ns.Skin()` is `""`,
  `"classic"` or `"forever"`, and `ns.foreverSkin` is true on Forever. A change takes a reload.
- It dresses the windows as WoW Forever's own (Talents, Spellbook, Character, Professions) and is
  built on their art. Every atlas is asked for with `C_Texture.GetAtlasInfo` first (once, then
  remembered), and a whole frame only through `NineSliceUtil` when all of its pieces exist; when one
  is missing the part is drawn from the `FOREVER_*` tokens in `Style.lua`, so nothing shows a missing
  texture. A file texture is checked by `SetTexture`'s answer the same way.
- Nothing is inherited from a Blizzard template: our frames take the art (`SetAtlas`,
  `NineSliceUtil.ApplyLayoutByName` on a frame of our own), so no Blizzard script or secure code runs.
- A window's frame is the game's portrait frame (`PortraitFrameTemplate`'s nine-slice) on a frame
  laid round the window: `FOREVER_TITLE_H` above it for the title bar, `FOREVER_SIDE` out on the
  other sides, so nothing inside the window moves. Its name is the addon's, in gold, centred on the
  bar; the Naowh logo sits in the portrait, which takes the old logo's click, and the window's own
  close button gives way to the game's red one. The title bar drags the window. Drawn, it is a rim of
  black, dark bronze, bronze, deep bronze and black with a ring round the portrait.
- The chrome sits `FOREVER_CHROME_LEVEL` over the window, under the size grip, so the metal edge is
  drawn over the content's edge as the game draws it.
- A window's backdrop is the game's rock (`UI-Background-Rock`), darkened (`FOREVER_ROCK_SHADE`) and
  partly see-through (`FOREVER_ROCK_ALPHA`), fading with the window's opacity.
- Every button is the game's one red button, the Friends list's Add Friend
  (`SharedButtonTemplate`, `Blizzard_SharedXML/Shared/Button/ThreeSliceButtonTemplate.xml` on the
  `forever` branch): the `128-RedButton` three-slice (`128-RedButton-Left`, `_128-RedButton-Center`,
  `128-RedButton-Right`, each with `-Pressed` and `-Disabled`, and `128-RedButton-Highlight`), named as
  `ThreeSliceButtonMixin` names them (`ThreeSliceButtonTemplate.lua`), its ends scaled to the button's
  height and cropped when it is narrow, as the game's are. Gold text, white under the mouse, grey when
  disabled (`FOREVER_DISABLED_TEXT_RGB`, as `GameFontDisable`). There is no main-action variant: the
  game uses the one red button, so `ns.AccentBorder` leaves it as it is, and a picked button's colored
  edge still shows. Without the atlases it is drawn: a red gradient (`FOREVER_RED_RGB`, brighter under
  the mouse, grey when disabled) in a bronze rim. The onboarding's Forever preview uses the same art
  (`Parts.ForeverButtonArt`).
- Tabs are the game's panel tabs turned to sit on top, as its top tabs are: their art flipped and
  `FOREVER_TOP_TAB_SHARE` of it tall (`FOREVER_TOP_TAB_CROP`). The picked one is the lit tab.
- A settings card is only its list bar, the Friends list's category header ("Favorites 0/2"):
  `SocialUIScrollableHeaderTemplate` (`Blizzard_SocialUIShared/SocialUISharedTemplates.xml`) on
  `ListHeaderVisualTemplate` (`Blizzard_SharedXML/ListTemplates.xml`), whose bar is
  `common-button-list-collapseExpand`. It is `FOREVER_CARD_BAR_H` tall and `FOREVER_CARD_GAP` apart,
  with no card box round it: a bar inside a box read as boxes in boxes. Its title is gold, its summary
  right-aligned before the sign, and the sign is the header's collapse button: `common-button-list-plus`
  or `common-button-list-minus` at the atlas's own size (`CollapseButtonMixin`, `ListTemplates.lua`),
  centered `FOREVER_SIGN_RIGHT` in from the right, with the same atlas as its glow. Stretched to a square
  the slim minus read as a solid yellow block, so it never is. Its switch, a check box, sits at its
  left. Drawn, the bar is a lighter brown gradient in a thin rim with a gold `+` or `-`. An open
  card's rows lie right under its bar (`FOREVER_BODY_GAP` above and below them), and the page is as
  tall as its bars and open rows, so it reflows as a card opens or closes. Groups are the character
  sheet's title
  plaque (`UI-Character-Info-Title`), `FOREVER_PILL_W` wide; settings rows lie on its stat line
  (`UI-Character-Info-Line-Bounce`), every other line, with gold labels. A pair of rows side by side
  is one line: the band turns over when the row's top changes, and starts again under each card head
  and group.
- A check box is the game's own beveled one (`UI-CheckBox-Up`, `-Down` and `-Highlight`, with
  `UI-CheckBox-Check`), `FOREVER_CHECK_SIZE` square everywhere, the card bars' switches too, so every
  box matches; its highlight lights it under the mouse. Without the file it is drawn: a dark
  `FOREVER_CHECK_DRAWN` box in the same square, the game's yellow tick a size up (`FOREVER_CHECK_SCALE`).
  A row that is off (its card switched off, or a setting it needs) keeps its box whole, as the game's
  disabled check button does (`UICheckButtonArtTemplate`, `Blizzard_SharedXML/Shared/Button/
  CheckButtonTemplates.xml`): `UI-CheckBox-Up` at `FOREVER_CHECK_DIM_ALPHA` and, ticked,
  `UI-CheckBox-Check-Disabled`; the label dims as before. Fading the whole box made it vanish.
- The help card is the game's help tip: its gradient, a yellow edge two pixels wide, and the talent
  frame's yellow pointer under it when it sits over what it explains (none at the cursor).
- The options window is laid out as the game's Legacy Challenges window (`Parts.ForeverPanes`).
  Under the title bar a header band (`FOREVER_BAND_H`) holds the page's name and path, clear of the
  portrait, and Enable, HUD Editor and Reload UI at its right, so no strip is spent on two buttons.
  A bronze rail (`FOREVER_RAIL`) closes the band off and runs down between the module list and the
  content.
- Its sidebar has no logo: the portrait ring is the brand. The search box sits at its top, and the
  modules under it are darker list bars (`FOREVER_LEAF_SHADE`, `FOREVER_BAR_GAP` from the next) with
  no icons, the picked one lit and edged in gold. The content is the frame's own rock, lighter in
  the middle (`FOREVER_LIGHT_ALPHA`), not a boxed inset, with its section tabs at its top. A module's
  own window keeps its content in the game's inset frame.
- A slim scroll bar has the game's chevrons at its ends (`Parts.ForeverScrollArrows`), each a wheel
  notch, and like the bar they show only when the list overflows.
- Settings, Profiles, Patch Notes and Credits are the game's side tabs (`common-sidetab`), hung on
  the frame's outer right edge (`FOREVER_SIDE` out, where the metal ends), outside the content. The
  window clips nothing, so none of them is cut off.
- Fonts are the game's, as on Classic+: Friz Quadrata for text and headings, Arial Narrow for
  numbers, unless an Addon Font is picked.

## Checking

`lua Tools/regression/test-shared.lua` loads these files as `Shared.xml` lists them, against
stubs: nothing made at load, the item helpers, the Forever mark, and the row engine (rows
pooled and reused, one redraw per burst of events, none while hidden, no garbage). A module's
own test loads them the same way before its files, with `Tools/regression/load_files.lua`
and `toc_files.lua`, and times its draws with `measure.lua`: see
`test-dungeon-journal.lua` and `test-bis-window.lua`. A test that lists Shared files by hand
lists every file the parts it uses are made in: `Parts.lua` with `Marks.lua`, `Text.lua`,
`Hud.lua`, `Timer.lua`, `Share.lua` and `Panels.lua`; `Window.lua` with `Tabs.lua` and
`SettingsCard.lua`; `Items.lua` with `Gear.lua`.

`lua Tools/regression/test-forever-skin.lua` builds every Forever part twice, on a client with all of
the game's art and on one with none of it, and checks Naowh and Classic+ make none of it. It draws a
settings page (bare bars that reflow as a card opens and closes) and builds the options window on
Forever: its header band and rails, the buttons on the band, no sidebar logo and no boxed content.
