# BiS List

Your best-in-slot picks for every gear slot, ranked: your BiS (an orange star), your second
pick (a silver one), then the rest. Picks come from wowsrc.com's ranking for your spec, from
every dungeon drop your class can use, or from Alt+Shift-clicking any item. The list has its
own window (`/nfbis`, a key binding, or the BiS stat in the Dungeon Journal): your paperdoll
on the left, a card per slot with its picks on the right, where to run next (a waypoint on
whoever has your BiS out in the world) and the best enchant for what you wear; and a Quests
page, the quests that reward a pick you do not have yet, as the Dungeon Journal shows its own.
Listed items say so on their tooltip, and call out when they drop. Lists are shared by every
character of a class, and can be shared as a string.

What drops in a dungeon, and where, is the [Dungeon Journal](../../NaowhForever_DungeonJournal/README.md)'s:
the picker's dungeon drops and an item's boss and dungeon come from its data, so the two always
agree. Without it the list still works, from wowsrc's sources; the picker's dungeon drops, the
Quests page and Run Next's levels and quests say to turn it on instead.

Laid out like the [Dungeon Journal](../../NaowhForever_DungeonJournal/README.md), on
[`Shared/`](../../Shared/README.md).

## I want to change...

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| A colour, a size, a font size, an icon | `View/Style.lua`, or `Shared/Style.lua` for the house look (the stars) |
| What a class can wear or wield | `Rankings.lua` |
| A spec's ranking | `python Tools/build_bis_data.py` (daily in CI) |
| Where an item drops | A dungeon drop: the Dungeon Journal's data (`Tools/build_journal.py`), which the BiS List reads; anything else: `Tools/bis_sources.json`, then rebuild |
| What a list keeps, or an old format | `Lists.lua` (saved lists) and `Sharing.lua` (strings) |
| Which enchant or upgrade wins for a spec | the spec's weights in `StatWeights/Data/Defaults.lua` (players change their own in the module's page); a proc's worth in `PROCS` in `Tools/build_enchants.py` |
| Where a zone's NPC stands | `python Tools/build_bis_spots.py` (on our machines: it reads Wowhead) |
| The quests that reward a BiS | `python Tools/build_bis_quests.py`, then `python Tools/build_quest_chains.py` |

## Why

- A list is `{ id, name, spec, slots = { [slot] = itemID }, extra = { [slot] = { itemID... } },
  bySpec = { [spec] = { slots, extra } } }`: `slots[slot]` is a slot's BiS, `extra[slot]` its next
  picks in order. Each spec keeps its own picks on a list; switching parks the current ones under
  `bySpec`.
- Lists are kept per class in the account store, so every character of a class shares them and none
  travels in an exported profile; each character remembers which one it uses.
- Older saved lists are moved when read: a character's own list from before lists were shared joins
  its class's (named for the character unless it had a name), a flat item list is put in slots, and
  the unordered next picks of the 0.5.12 test builds go in ranked order.
- A list's name shows in chat and tooltips, so its escape codes are neutralised (`|` doubled) and it
  is cut to `NAME_MAX` letters.
- A two-hander as the main hand's BiS leaves the off hand unused: its picks are kept, not counted,
  until the main hand's BiS is a one-hander again.
- Share strings are parsed as data, never run. Version 1 is a flat item list, placed as an old saved
  list is; 2 has BiS picks only; 3 has next picks unordered, put in the spec's ranked order; 4 has
  next picks in order.
- What drops in a dungeon, and the boss and dungeon an item comes from, are the Dungeon Journal's,
  so the two list the same items under the same bosses. The Journal loads after the BiS List, so
  `Rankings.lua`, `Quests.lua` and `Sources.lua` read it the first time they are asked, never at load.
- A boss's drop beats a trash drop of the same item (trash counts as a chance of -1), and the boss
  likeliest to drop it is the one named.
- `SOURCE_SEP` is the middle dot wowsrc puts between a boss and its place; each source is split once.
- The picker lists only ranked items the running client knows: an unknown ID never finishes loading.
  Dungeon drops "near your level" are within `NEAR_LEVELS` (10) of yours.
- Run Next shows at most three places, the ones that make you strongest first (by the gains), then
  the one with the most of your BiS. A quest, a craft or a faction's reward is not a place but a
  click goes there all the same; a world drop is nowhere to go.
- A quest for your own side says only "Quest": the list gives you no quest of the other's.
- The quests are the Journal's records (its `Data/BiSQuests.lua`), so its rules (what to do first,
  the level, the chain, the waypoint, tracking) work on them. A quest's race limit is kept aside, as
  the Journal's rules know none; a race the mask does not know of is let through. `RACE_BITS` is your
  race's bit in a quest's races mask (`ChrRaces.PlayableRaceBit`): the classic eight, and Forever's
  Skyborne.
- A quest starts where Wowhead maps its quest giver, else the map of the Journal's quest giver, else
  the dungeon it starts inside.
- Enchants: the game puts no level limit on any; the level is advice. `SKILL_LEVELS` follows the
  trainers, who teach up to 75 at level 5, 150 at 10, 225 at 20 and 300 at 35; Forever's recipes past
  300 come from its endgame (`ENDGAME_LEVEL`). Of two as good, the cheaper recipe wins. A special
  enchant (a proc no stat can say) shows when the spec values its stat at `SPECIAL_WORTH` or more.
  Weapon damage per swing is worth the weapon's damage per second over its speed.
- An item's stats are fixed, so each is read once (through Stat Weights' bounded cache); what you
  wear is read by its link, as a suffix ("of the Monkey") changes its stats.
- The upgrade percent is an estimate, as the weights are: it orders upgrades, it does not promise a
  number on a meter.
- Drop Alert speaks once per drop: a roll by its ID, a loot window's item by the corpse and the item,
  and an item said in the last `SAME_DROP` seconds (a boss's roll, then its loot window) not again.
  What was said is let go after `FORGET` seconds. Looted, won or handed to you is "yours", but not a
  second copy of what you wear. The loot events are listened to only while the module and Drop Alert
  are on, on a frame made the first time.
- The roll badge is ours, anchored to the game's roll frame and never kept on it; Forever's roll
  frames are unverified, so a missing one just goes without.
- The toast's star is on a frame of its own above the icon (`STAR_LIFT` levels, over the icon's
  corner badge too): the icon is a frame, so a texture on the alert would sit under it. Live toasts
  stack under a holder you move in Unlock Mode; nothing is made before the first.
- Bag Marks: ours is a frame over each bag button, kept in our own table (nothing stored on theirs),
  painted after the bag paints the slot. Off, nothing is hooked or made; turned off after being on,
  ours hide and EllesmereUI's overlay hook is let go. Your weights and what your gear is worth are
  read once a frame: a bag paints every slot in one go, EllesmereUI one slot per call. On
  EllesmereUI's buttons its BoE word puts our star after it, Pawn's arrow our item level before it,
  and its own item level hides while ours stands in for it. A level shows on gear only, in its
  quality's colour (gold for common and poor) so it never reads as a stack count.
- An item's card comes up over its icon and name only, so it never covers the list while the mouse
  crosses a row; the zone takes the mouse over it, not its clicks (`SetMouseClickEnabled(false)`
  after `SetScript`, as setting mouse scripts turns clicks back on).
- A row's gain bar is its share of the list's biggest gain by the square root, so +1% still shows
  beside +18%. A gain of `GAIN_BIG` and up is the upgrade green, under `GAIN_SMALL` muted.
- The backup tree's branch sits `TREE_DROP` under the row's middle, level with the rank's letters:
  the Naowh font leaves room above its capitals, so a line on the middle reads a pixel high
  (unmeasured; check in game).
- The summary is not a row of the list: the window pins it over it, so it stays in sight however far
  the list scrolls.
- The paperdoll leaves the ranged slot off the model, as trying it on takes a hand. A new model frame
  starts shown, so its OnShow covers only later shows and the first dress is made at once.
- Handing the screen to the Dungeon Journal or the world map (Run Next, a source) puts the window
  away; it comes back when that one closes, unless it was opened again meanwhile.
- The Quests page is a Journal view, made the first time the page opens, as the Journal loads after
  the BiS List.

## Checking

- `lua Tools/regression/test-bis-slots.lua`: lists, picks, old formats, sharing, Run Next.
- `lua Tools/regression/test-bis-dungeon-drops.lua`: class rules, dungeon drops, sources.
- `lua Tools/regression/test-bis-window.lua`: the window, paperdoll and picker, a click
  changing the list, the redraw's cost (no garbage), Drop Alert only listening while on and as
  you set it (which picks, alert, chat, sounds, its look, and the settings page's studio and
  rows), Run Next's waypoints, and enchants by spec and item level.
- `lua Tools/regression/test-bag-marks.lua`: Bag Marks in the game's bags and EllesmereUI's.
- `lua Tools/regression/test-dungeon-journal.lua`: also the Quests page, the quests that
  reward your picks, by zone, for your side, class and race.
