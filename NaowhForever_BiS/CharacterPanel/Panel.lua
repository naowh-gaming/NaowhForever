--  Panel.lua -- the Naowh character panel (ns.CharacterPanel): the game's character panel in
--  the BiS List's look. Blizzard keeps the panel and all it does (its slots' clicks, drags and
--  tooltips, its tabs, its stats); Naowh fades its art (SetAlpha, never Hide) and lays its own
--  frames over it, from post-hooks only. Off by default, and nothing is hooked until it is
--  first turned on.
--
--  EllesmereUI styles the same panel, and the two are never on at once. Turning Naowh's on turns
--  EllesmereUI's Character Sheet off (its own switch, EllesmereUIDB.themedCharacterSheet, as its
--  options set it), and turning Naowh's off turns it back on, if it was Naowh's that turned it
--  off; either way after a reload, which EllesmereUI needs to swap its look. Should EllesmereUI's
--  come back on by other means, Naowh's stands down. CP.Rival is that rule for any of the game's
--  windows both style: the Naowh Inspect Panel (InspectPanel/) uses it for the inspect window.
