# Inspect Panel

The game's inspect window in the BiS List's look, as the Naowh Character Panel dresses the
character panel, with a pane of ours on its right for the player you inspect. Blizzard keeps the
window and everything it does: its slots' clicks and tooltips, ctrl-click to the dressing room,
the Talents button, the Guild tab. Naowh fades its art (`SetAlpha`, never `Hide`), widens the
window by the pane (its own frames keep their width on the left) and lays its own frames over
it, from post-hooks only.

On by default (QoL > Character > Inspect Panel), like the Character Panel, and nothing is hooked
or built until the game loads its inspect window (`Blizzard_InspectUI`, on the first inspect).
EllesmereUI's inspect sheet and this one are never on at once, by the Character Panel's rule
(`CP.Rival`): turning this on turns `EllesmereUIDB.themedInspectSheet` off, off turns it back on if
this was what turned it off, either way with a reload offered; while EllesmereUI's is on
(`EllesmereUI.GetBlizzWindowStyle("inspect")`), this stands down.

## What it shows

```

+------------------------------------------+----------------------+
```

- **Slots:** the character panel's look (`CP.SlotOver`): an edge in the item's quality colour,
  the item level, Forever's mark; the green arrow on what would be an upgrade for you by your
  stat weights (hover the slot for how much); an orange dot on a slot an enchanter could enchant
  that has none. Their BiS star shows only when their own Naowh Forever answers with their list
  (`TheirBiS.lua`); your BiS star and your enchant advice are about your gear, so they are not
  shown on theirs.
- **Score card:** their Naowh Score as your panel's card, yours under it to compare. Read from
  their gear while the game's inspect data is theirs, "..." while their items load.
- **Badge plate:** their supporter badge in the model's corner, as yours on your panel.
- **Player tab:** talents (points per tree, their lead tree and its role, and one of Naowh's
  Training Planner builds by name when their points follow it), the gear check (unenchanted and
  empty slots, item level, upgrades for you), their guild and how you know them, and your note
  and tag on them (Player History's).
- **History tab:** with Player History on, how often you grouped, your last groups and the last
  lines either of you said, as plain text.

We cannot read another player's stats, so the pane has none: the score, the gear check and the
talents say what the stats would.

## Their BiS

Asked of the player inspected by addon whisper (`NaowhInspect`), answered by their Naowh Forever
with which of the items they wear are on their list and its rank there, in one message under
255 bytes. An answer is kept only for the ask out, from that player (name and GUID matched
against the inspect unit), while the window still shows them, every field checked; answers are
rate-limited per asker and in all, and nothing they sent goes back. Share Your BiS (on by
default) is the answering side.

## Layout

```
InspectPanel/
  InspectPanel.xml     what loads, in order
  InspectPanel.lua     the namespace (ns.InspectPanel), its switch, the window widened and dressed,
                       whose inspect data the game holds (IP.Ready), the refresh each part paints on
  Slots.lua            the slots and the gear check
  TheirBiS.lua         their BiS asked and kept; yours answered
  Card.lua             the score card and the badge plate
  Details.lua          the Player tab
  History.lua          the History tab
  UI/SettingsPage.lua  its card on QoL > Character
```

Its sizes and colours shared with the Character Panel come from `CP.C` (`CharacterPanel/Constants.lua`).

## Blizzard's side (Forever, `Blizzard_InspectUI`, `Camelot` and `Mainline` files)

- `InspectFrame` (`Camelot/Blizzard_InspectUI.xml`, `ButtonFrameTemplate`): `OnShow` and `OnHide`
  hooked; shown on `INSPECT_READY` for `InspectFrame.unit`.
- `InspectPaperDollItemSlotButton_Update` (`Mainline/InspectPaperDollFrame.lua`): post-hooked to
  paint our slot frames over `Inspect<Slot>Slot` (`Camelot/InspectPaperDollFrame.xml`).
- `FrameTemplate_SetButtonBarHeight` (`Blizzard_SharedXML/Mainline/SharedUIPanelTemplates.lua`):
  post-hooked so the inset keeps its width when the paper doll or guild tab moves its bottom.
- `INSPECTFRAME_SUBFRAMES` (`Camelot/Blizzard_InspectUI_Overrides.lua`): the tabs' frames, kept on
  the left part of the wider window.

## Why

- Each part paints on `IP.Refresh` with the unit and GUID shown, and reads the game's inspect data
  only while `IP.Ready` says it is that player's: a stale `INSPECT_READY` is ignored.
- Gear the game says they wear but sends none of (an inspect cleared under the window) is asked for
  again once per player shown, so the window fills in rather than showing them bare.
- Item data that is still loading is read again `LOAD_SETTLE` seconds after the last
  `GET_ITEM_INFO_RECEIVED`, once for a burst.
- Their BiS is asked by addon whisper, so a player without Naowh Forever never answers and shows no
  stars. The ask is `1 Q <their GUID> <your GUID>`; the answer `1 A <your GUID> <slot>:<item ID>:<rank>,...`
  (`-` for none), one message under `MAX_BYTES` (255), cut short when a list would not fit. The kind
  of message is its third byte (`KIND_AT`).
- An answer is kept only for the ask out, from the player inspected (their name and GUID matched
  against the inspect unit itself, as strangers are not in your group or guild), while the window
  still shows them, every field checked, and only for the item still worn in that slot.
- Answering: only whispers that ask, at most once per `ANSWER_GAP` for each asker and `ANSWERS_MAX`
  in all every `ANSWERS_WINDOW` seconds; nothing they sent goes back. Asking: at most once per
  `ASK_GAP` for each player, only of your own faction.
- Talents are read from the game's inspect talent data only while it is that player's; anything not
  known yet reads "...". `IP.ReadTalentTrees` and `IP.ReadInspectTalents` are shared with Group Inspect.
- Chat in the History tab is someone else's text: shown as plain text only (`ns.PlainText`), never as
  a format or with its codes. The tab is there only while Player History is on.
- Your BiS star and your enchant advice are about your gear, so they are not shown on theirs; an
  orange dot marks a slot an enchanter could enchant that has none.

## Checking

`lua Tools/regression/test-inspect-panel.lua`: off and hooking nothing; waiting for the game's
inspect window; on, the art faded, the window widened and each part painted for the GUID shown;
a stale `INSPECT_READY` ignored; the BiS round trip and every way an answer is dropped; the
answering side's limits; History with a record, without one and without the module; missing APIs;
standing down for EllesmereUI; the art back when off; and no garbage from a slot's update, a
refresh or an answer read.
