# Blessings

Paladin blessings: a blessing per class, or per player where one needs something else, shared with
the group's other paladins running Naowh Forever, and a bar that casts it. A class button blesses
the next member of that class who needs it; a class's player list blesses one person. Aura and
Righteous Fury buttons sit at the front. The group leader and assistants can set every paladin's
plan, in the Blessings window (`/nfbless`, Assignments on a class button's menu, Open Blessings on
its settings page). Its settings are in the QoL store (`blessings` and the `bless*` keys), on the
Blessings/Settings page, whose preview edits the bar on plain frames, never its secure ones.

## Why

- The ranks are lowest first, from Forever's spell data (build 1.60.1.69913).
- Forever names carry a surname: `UnitName` gives only the first name ("Glyadin"), while
  `UnitFullName` and addon message senders give the whole one ("Glyadin Skywolf"). Names are kept as
  senders carry them: the realm only when it is not ours. Another paladin's plan is kept by that
  name (realm when not ours): `{ classes, aura, known }`.
- The saved plan once held only `{ CLASS = blessing }`, before per-player choices and auras; such a
  plan is read into the new shape.
- Unit identity and auras can come back secret in restricted content; those are skipped. A member
  whose data has not arrived yet reads "Unknown" with no class; the next roster or aura update picks
  them up.
- A group header matches its `nameList` against `UnitName` in a party and `GetRaidRosterInfo` in a
  raid, which on Forever can be the first name alone. Every name the header could compare for a
  member is counted once per member (`NAME_SLOTS`); a name two members share (two of them "Bob" to
  the header) is left out for both, so the header cannot pick the wrong one, and the class buttons
  skip them.
- A Greater Blessing reaches the whole class, so it is only cast when everyone in the class is down
  for the same blessing; otherwise the single one, so nobody's own choice is replaced. It uses a
  Symbol of Kings (`SYMBOL_OF_KINGS`), and covers the whole class, so it is cast once.
- A buff's state is present (with the time left when it runs out), missing, or nil when unreadable.
  Aura access can be withdrawn outside combat lockdown too (seen on boss pulls), and
  `GetAuraDataByIndex` then raises instead of returning nil, so the restriction is checked before the
  call. Reads are remembered for one refresh, so every ask in it reads a member's buffs once.
- Range is true, false, or nil when the game gives no answer (left to the cast); a secret answer
  counts as no answer.
- A class button blesses, in order: missing first, then running out (under `EXPIRING`, five
  minutes), then whoever has the least left, skipping anyone dead, offline or out of range. Only a
  member in range the button can reach lights it: red when someone is missing the class blessing,
  yellow when only running out, blue when only players on their own blessing need theirs. With
  Apply Theme to Status Colours they are the theme's Accent, its lighter Accent and a deeper shade.
- A class button's left-click goes to the next member of its queue, so in combat (where the queue is
  the one from before the pull) repeated clicks go through those who needed it, round again after
  the last, as a missed click cannot be told from a cast. The button is its group header's child, and
  the header finds that member by name, wherever the raid has moved them. One the header no longer
  finds (they left) leaves the button without a unit, and a spell with none would go to the current
  target, so they are skipped. Out of combat a click reads the class again first.
- A mouse click acts on release, so the class buttons take up clicks only: one step per click. Addon
  buttons otherwise follow `ActionButtonUseKeyDown` and act only on the press. The key bindings are
  key down only, so a press casts and steps once whatever that setting is.
- The key bindings (Key Bindings > AddOns, `Bindings.xml`) are aimed again on every refresh out of
  combat; in combat, where buffs cannot be read, each steps through the list it had when the fight
  began, one press per entry: the single blessing for everyone due, and a Greater one per class whose
  members all share its blessing, cast on the most urgent of them.
- The secure group header owns its button's unit, so the button follows one named player through
  raid reordering, even in combat. Headers only build their button while visible, so the parent must
  be shown when one is made. The secure class button hides while nobody can be blessed; the menu
  still opens from the icon.
- Secure buttons only change out of combat; a change asked for in one waits. So does one asked for
  while auras are unreadable: every buff would read unknown and the class buttons would lose their
  spell, then stay empty once combat locks them. The bar is only built out of combat (a reload in
  one builds it once the fight ends), and cannot be dragged in combat.
- Blizzard's managed aura display draws a buff's presence and time left, in combat too, without addon
  code reading secret aura data. The frame under it stays red, so only a missing buff shows red.
  Forever may not ship the display, so it is optional. Its button sits over the button's own icon, so
  the black border still shows; not with `PixelInset`, since a Blizzard aura button's `IsVisible` is
  secret and refitting it raises. When the header points a player-list button at another unit mid
  fight, the display follows.
- A plan travels as ten characters: a blessing code per class in `CLASSES` order, then the aura's,
  "-" for none. Per-player choices travel as GUID=code pairs in batches; "P|1|" starts the list over,
  so an empty one clears what the others had, and at most `MAX_PLAYER_CHOICES` are kept per paladin.
- Messages are parsed as data: only valid codes from a paladin in the group are kept, and only the
  leader or an assistant can set someone else's plan. Nothing is sent in combat: what would have
  been is kept, the latest per kind and target, and sent once combat ends. Every client asks on a
  roster change, so answers are batched into one send a second later.
- Auras and the roster change constantly in a raid: one rescan a second at most, and one exchange of
  plans per second. Except right after your own cast: the bar shows the blessing landing on the next
  frame, so a click is not answered by a second of the old red; that window stays open for a second,
  at most one rescan a frame, since in a group other auras change first and a Greater Blessing's class
  can land over more than one frame. `UNIT_AURA` fires for every unit the client tracks; a queued
  rescan already covers it, and in combat a refresh would only mark the bar dirty, so both skip the
  unit test. Range and time left change with nothing to announce them, so the bar rescans every
  `TICK` seconds out of combat.
- Auto-Assign: each class's blessings, most wanted first. In a raid Salvation moves up for classes
  that do not tank; warriors, druids and paladins never get it, so a tank is never handed it. Whoever
  knows least picks first, so a paladin with few blessings is not left with none, and each wanted
  blessing goes to the first paladin still free who knows it; one aura each. Another paladin's plan
  is kept here until their broadcast confirms it, and sent to them; planning everyone's needs the
  leader or an assistant when another paladin is involved.
- The preset is one saved set of plans for the account, by paladin name. Loading it plans only the
  paladins in it who are here now, each keeping to what they have learned.
- A class label too long for its slot under the bar (the button plus the gap after it) first shrinks,
  down to `LABEL_MIN`, then drops to its first three letters at that size, and is cut off if even
  that is too long, so neighbours never run into each other. Letters are counted in whole UTF-8
  characters, so a localized name never splits. Nothing sits beside a column's names, so only a row's
  are fitted. The class icon (Class Label Style: Class Icon) is two thirds of the button, kept between
  `CLASS_ICON_MIN` and `CLASS_ICON_MAX`, and made the first time it is asked for.
